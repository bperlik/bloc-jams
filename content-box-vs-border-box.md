# The difference between default box-sizing and border-box

   ## box-sizing;
     * the default is content-box
     * width and height include **only content** NOT padding, border, or margin
     * makes the content the width x height but the padding and border can be different

   ## boxsizing: border-box
     * width and height **content, padding and border**
     * makes the boxes the same size to the border, same size
     * only the margin is left outside of the the width x height
     * useful to make different content sizes become the same size box
