# Relative vs Absolute Position

## Relative
 * Adjusts away from the *normal flow* position by using Top Right Bottom Left
 * Example: 
   * position: relative;
   * right: 30 px;
   * would move position 30px to left from the normal position - center 

## Absolute
 * Adjust position away from perimeter of *nearest positioned ancestor* 
 * Uses top right bottom left
 * Example: 
   * position: absolute;
   * right: 30 px;
   * would position this inside the nearest positioned ancestor
   * with 30px from the right border
